The Readme
1. THe Readme file is the first file visible on the Github website and both the title and authors names are included.
2. The purpose of the program is clearly stated in the introduction. eLISA is designed to scan an eDNA analysis file and search through and Invasive Species Database, returning data information on an identified species.
3. There is a program workflow that includes images which is very helpful in understaning how the program works. The program contains a python script that is used to sort through the eDNA data file and an R script that will search the Invasive Species Dataset for an invasive species. The scripts are concatenated into a bash script that is run in Hoffman2.
4. The dependencies are indicated in the workflow and Hoffman2 requirements are indicated.
5. There are instructions for running the program. They are short and straight to the point which makes it easy to understand.
6. The Github page has a vignette folder that contains examples of outputs produced by eLISA.
7. The R package used was cited as well as Python and R.

The Scripts
8. There is a directory that contains the programs scripts.

The Vignette
10. There is a folder call vignette that includes intructions on how to run the program, example data set and example outputs.
11. I was able to run the vignette with no problems; hoever it did take a while for the R package to load but that was indicated by the authors.
12. I reproduced the exact output that was displayed in the Github website.

General
13. The program is great! Very well designed. However, the introduction is quite lengthy and overwhelming, perhabs making it shorter would be more inviting. Also maybe making the images a bit smaller, they are somewhat overpowering and take away from the rest of the great work!
