1. The Readme file is the first file displayed on the Github website. The title and name of the author is displayed along with her contact information. 
2. The purpose of the program is clearly stated. Keira designed a program that will take species tables data and match the species with repective trait data. 
3. The program workflow is very straightforward. The program reads a file from an Anacapa output file and extracts unique species. It then uses the R package 'fishbase' to create tables of specific ecological data and finally concatenating the information into one table.
4. There are dependencies indicated but they are not in the workflow, they have their own section after the workflow. Specific Hoffman requirements are indicated.  
5. There are instructions for running the program. They are understanable but it would be useful to indicate which package must be installed first at the beginning of the directions.
6. The vignette folder has example input and outputs. They are also on the main directory.
7. The research programs used and dependencies are cited.
8. There is not a directory that contains all the program scripts other than the main directory.
9. N/A
10. There is a directory called vignette that included an example data set and example output.
11. I was able to run the vignette with the data set; however, it took me a while to understand how the program worked and what each steo meant. 
12. I did reproduce the expected output!
13. Great Job on creating the program! I would recommend adding a picture for the workflow section. Also the command line in the Readme and vignette are slightly different which was confusing at first.
